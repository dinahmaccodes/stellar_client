# Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the Fundable Stellar project's architecture, which is composed of three main parts: a web frontend, a TypeScript SDK, and Soroban smart contracts.

## High-Level Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the interaction between the main components of the system:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] --> B{Frontend (Next.js)};
    B --> C{SDK (@fundable/sdk)};
    C --> D{Soroban Smart Contracts};
    D --> E((Stellar Blockchain));

    subgraph "Client-Side"
        A
        B
    end

    subgraph "Off-Chain"
        C
    end

    subgraph "On-Chain"
        D
        E
    end
```

### Components

-   **Frontend (Next.js):** The user-facing web application that allows users to interact with the Fundable Protocol.
-   **SDK (@fundable/sdk):** A TypeScript library that abstracts the communication with the Soroban smart contracts, providing a simple API for the frontend.
-   **Soroban Smart Contracts:** The on-chain logic that governs payment streams and token distribution.
-   **Stellar Blockchain:** The underlying blockchain where the smart contracts are deployed and transactions are recorded.

## Contract Architecture

The smart contract layer is composed of two main contracts, organized as a Cargo workspace.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Soroban Smart Contracts"
        P[Payment Stream Contract]
        D[Distributor Contract]
    end

    P -->|Manages| S[Streams];
    D -->|Performs| T[Token Distributions];

    subgraph "Payment Stream Functions"
        P_Create["create_stream()"]
        P_Withdraw["withdraw()"]
        P_Pause["pause_stream()"]
        P_Cancel["cancel_stream()"]
    end

    subgraph "Distributor Functions"
        D_Equal["distribute_equal()"]
        D_Weighted["distribute_weighted()"]
    end

    P_Create & P_Withdraw & P_Pause & P_Cancel --> P
    D_Equal & D_Weighted --> D

```

### Contracts

-   **Payment Stream Contract:** Manages the lifecycle of payment streams, including creation, withdrawal, pausing, and cancellation.
-   **Distributor Contract:** Handles the distribution of tokens to multiple recipients, with support for both equal and weighted distributions.
